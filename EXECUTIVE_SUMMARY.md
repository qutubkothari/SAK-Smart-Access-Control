# 🎯 SAK Smart Access Control - Executive Presentation

## 📊 Problem Statement

### Current Challenges in Visitor Management:

### Business Impact:

Fill paper form              Scan QR code
  ↓ (3 mins)                   ↓ (Instant)
Reception calls host         Host auto-notified
  ↓ (5-10 mins)                ↓ (Immediate)
